Paper: Visual Representation of Online Handwriting Time Series for Deep Learning Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Detection
Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8893041

Concept: Using online signal vizualised as LSTM to detect parkinson disease-reated patterns in writing

-> Concept of x,y,z,azimute, etc
-> Few data, hard to train deep learning networks on them
-> Feed to data to B-LSTM (X,Y,Z) for pattern recognition in handwriting

Although the goal is a bit dissimilar to us (Variation over time vs prediction/generation over time), the context is quite similar (handwriting) and the technique considering x,y as timeseries seem to bring good results.
