Topic: Using CNN to assess chinese penmanship

Paper is not really relevant, simple effective architecture. Important is: There are databases of chinese handwriting, online/offline, that could be used to support the project and be usefull ? For:
- inspection of generalization capability
- test of other dructuses
- More data for transformers that are data-hungry

Problem: Time is not included, regrouped by stroke but no mention of frequency, seems like a dead end.
